Overview

This project implements a Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal of this system is to recognize and transcribe text from handwritten images into machine-readable text.

Features

Utilizes a CNN architecture for image feature extraction.
Implements preprocessing techniques like normalization and data augmentation.
Trains the model using labeled handwritten text datasets.
Evaluates model performance on validation and test sets.
Provides inference functionality to recognize text from new handwritten images.
